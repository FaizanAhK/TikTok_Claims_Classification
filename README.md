# TikTok_Claims_Classification

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis Project for Claims Classification performed on TikTok.

## Objective

The TikTok Data team seeks to develop a machine learning model to assist in the classification of claims for user submissions. In this part of the project, the data needs to be analyzed, stored, cleaned and structured prior to any model building.

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the provided dataset. Our objective is to perform EDA on the dataset with the aim of learning more about the variables. Of particular interest is information related to what distinguishes claim videos from opinion videos.
## Goal

The goal is to explore the dataset and create visualizations.
This activity has 4 parts:

### Part 1: Imports, links, and loading

### Part 2: Data Exploration

### Part 3: Build Visualizations

### Part 4: Evaluate and share results.


## Performing EDA

Importing helpful packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`

```python
# Import packages for data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import packages for data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
